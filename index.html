    <h1>Janay Patel</h1>
    <p>Aspiring Data Scientist | Innovator | Creative Storyteller</p>
    <p>Hi, I’m Janay! I’m a Grade 11 student from Winnipeg, Manitoba, passionate about data science and programming. I
      love exploring technology, mentoring others, and capturing creativity through photography and esports.

  <div id="About">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>
  <section class="content">
    <p>I’m a Grade 11 student from Winnipeg, Manitoba, balancing the unique challenges of dual
      enrollment.
      While still in high school, I’m also taking college-level courses at MITT through PTEC, where I’m gaining hands-on
      experience in both academics and practical skills. Education has always been a priority for me, but I also believe
      in
      exploring opportunities outside the classroom to grow as a person. That’s why I’ve dedicated my time to leadership
      roles, volunteering, and projects that help me make an impact in my community.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of my proudest achievements is mentoring Grade 6 kids at CanU. It’s not just about teaching—it’s about
      connecting
      with younger students and helping them see their own potential. Volunteering at the library has also been a
      rewarding
      experience, where I get to interact with people of all ages and contribute to something as timeless as the love
      for
      reading and learning. These experiences have taught me the value of giving back and building meaningful
      relationships.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I’m not studying or volunteering, you’ll often find me immersed in creative work. I have a deep passion for
      storytelling, whether it’s writing dramatic scripts like Silent Echoes and Echoes of Tomorrow or experimenting
      with
      photography to capture unique perspectives. Creativity helps me express myself and stay grounded. On a different
      note, I
      enjoy esports, which is a fun way to unwind and challenge myself competitively with friends.
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking ahead, I’m working towards becoming a data scientist—a field that combines my love for problem-solving and
      technology. I’m particularly interested in using AI to create meaningful solutions, like my work on the BrightPath
      app,
      which focuses on mental health. My goal is to continue pushing my limits and exploring how I can use my skills to
      create
      positive change, whether it’s through tech innovation, leadership, or creative storytelling.

  <div id="Goals">
    <h1>Goals</h1>
  </div>
  <section class="content">
    <p>In the short term, my biggest focus is on preparing for university and strengthening my skills in data science
      and AI.
      I’m working on projects like the BrightPath app, which uses AI to support mental health, and exploring innovative
      ideas
      like developing wearable devices for chronic pain management. These hands-on experiences help me build the
      technical
      knowledge and creativity I’ll need to succeed in the future. I’m also striving to excel in competitions like the
      Imagine
      Cup and the Scholastic Writing Awards, which challenge me to push my boundaries and showcase my potential.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of my major goals is to get accepted into a world-class university like MIT. I know the journey will be
      challenging,
      but I’m committed to putting in the work to make it happen. From building strong projects to maintaining good
      grades and
      participating in meaningful extracurriculars, I’m focused on creating a well-rounded profile that reflects my
      passion
      and determination. Education has always been important to me, and I see university as a place to grow not just
      academically but also personally, surrounded by people who inspire me to aim higher.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the long term, I want to become a leader in the field of data science, using my skills to solve real-world
      problems.
      Whether it’s through healthcare innovations, environmental solutions, or creative technologies, my goal is to
      create
      tools and products that make a difference in people’s lives. Beyond my professional aspirations, I want to
      continue
      writing stories that inspire others and volunteering in my community to give back in meaningful ways.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ultimately, my biggest goal is to lead a life of purpose, where I’m constantly learning, creating, and helping
      others.
      Whether it’s mentoring kids at CanU, writing a story that resonates with someone, or developing an AI solution
      that
      changes lives, I want every step I take to bring me closer to building a better future—not just for myself, but
      for the
      people around me.
